# ðŸŽ² Probability Calculator

This project simulates random experiments to calculate the **approximate probability** of drawing specific combinations of colored balls from a hat. It is part of the [freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

You are given a hat with various colored balls. The goal is to estimate the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls after a certain number of draws **without replacement**.

The project includes:
- A `Hat` class to manage the hat's contents and perform random draws.
- An `experiment()` function to simulate multiple experiments and estimate probability.
