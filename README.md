# FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python certification projects. Each project is organized into its own folder with a `main.py` script and a `README.md` for project-specific details.

## üìÅ Project List

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter
- **Description:** Formats arithmetic problems vertically.
- **Location:** `Arithmetic_Formatter/main.py`

### 2. Time Calculator
- **Description:** Adds durations to 12-hour clock times and returns updated time with optional day info.
- **Location:** `Time_Calculator/main.py`

### 3. Polygon Area Calculator
- **Description:** Creates a shape class that computes area, perimeter, and visual representation of polygons.
- **Location:** `Polygon_Area_Calculator/main.py`

### 4. Budget App
- **Description:** Tracks spending across categories and generates a text-based bar chart.
- **Location:** `Budget_App/main.py`

### 5. Probability Calculator
- **Description:** Performs probability experiments using random selections from a hat.
