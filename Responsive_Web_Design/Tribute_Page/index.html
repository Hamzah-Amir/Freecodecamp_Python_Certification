            <h1>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born <strong>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai</strong>; <strong>25 December
                    1876</strong> –
                <strong>11 September 1948</strong>) was a barrister, politician, and the revered founder of Pakistan.
                Serving as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the creation of Pakistan on
                <strong>14 August 1947</strong>, Jinnah became the country’s first Governor-General, a role he held
                until his passing.
                Widely known as the <em>Father of the Nation</em>, his vision, determination, and leadership were
                instrumental in
                carving out a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.
            </p>

            <p class="early-life">
                Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi—then part of the Bombay Presidency of British India—Jinnah was the
                eldest of seven children
                of Jinnahbhai Poonja and Mithibai Jinnah. His family hailed from a Khoja Muslim background with roots in
                Gujarat,
                and later followed Twelver Shi’a teachings, although accounts suggest he may have identified as Sunni
                later in life.
                Jinnah attended Sindh Madrassatul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School before moving
                to London at the age
                of 16. There, he trained as a barrister at <strong>Lincoln’s Inn</strong>, reputedly choosing it because
                its
                entrance displayed the names of history’s greatest lawgivers—including Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

            <h2>Barrister and Early Political Career</h2>
            <p class="career">
                At the age of 20, Jinnah began practicing law in Bombay, becoming the only Muslim barrister in the city
                at the time.
                Initially facing challenges, his career took a turn when he worked in the chambers of John Molesworth
                MacPherson,
                the acting Advocate General of Bombay. In 1900, he briefly served as a magistrate before returning to
                private practice,
                famously rejecting a lucrative permanent post with the remark that he intended to earn “1,500 rupees a
                day” — a goal
                he eventually achieved.
                <br><br>
                In the early decades of the 20th century, Jinnah was active in the Indian National Congress, advocating
                for
                <strong>Hindu-Muslim unity</strong> and playing a key role in the 1916 Lucknow Pact. Over time, as
                political tensions grew,
                he emerged as the unshakable voice for Muslim rights, eventually leading the demand for an independent
                Muslim state.
            </p>

            <h2>Role in the Creation of Pakistan</h2>
            <p class="politics">
                By the 1940s, Jinnah had become the undisputed leader of the All-India Muslim League. His relentless
                advocacy,
                constitutional expertise, and powerful oratory transformed the demand for a separate homeland into the
                reality of
                Pakistan. On <strong>14 August 1947</strong>, Pakistan emerged as an independent nation, fulfilling
                Jinnah’s vision
                for a sovereign Muslim state where people of all faiths could live in freedom.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Years and Legacy</h2>
            <p class="legacy">
                Despite ill health, Jinnah devoted his last year to setting the foundations of the new
                nation—emphasizing unity,
                discipline, and faith. He passed away on <strong>11 September 1948</strong> in Karachi, just over a year
                after Pakistan’s
                independence. His enduring legacy as the architect of Pakistan lives on, and he is honored every year on
                his birthday,
                <strong>25 December</strong>, with tributes across the country.
